# Label, Verify, Correct: A Simple Few-Shot Object Detection Method
Code for our paper: [Label, Verify, Correct: A Simple Few-Shot Object Detection Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06207)

> **Abstract:** *The objective of this paper is few-shot object detection (FSOD)
> – the task of expanding an object detector for a new category given only a few instances for training.
> We introduce a simple pseudo-labelling method to source high-quality pseudo-annotations from the training set,
> for each new category, vastly increasing the number of training instances and reducing class imbalance;
> our method finds previously unlabelled instances.
> Naïvely training with model predictions yields sub-optimal performance;
> we present two novel methods to improve the precision of the pseudo-labelling process:
> first, we introduce a verification technique to remove candidate detections with incorrect class labels;
> second, we train a specialised model to correct poor quality bounding boxes.
> After these two novel steps, we obtain a large set of high-quality pseudo-annotations that allow our final detector to be trained end-to-end. Additionally, we demonstrate our method maintains base class performance,
> and the utility of simple augmentations in FSOD.
> While benchmarking on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO,
> our method achieves state-of-the-art or second-best performance compared to existing approaches across all number of shots.*
